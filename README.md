Seed and Destiny digit based options for Number/Registration Plate

Seed digit is what you get after adding the digits of your 'date' of birth. 
e.g. Say your date is 29th of any month. After adding 2 & 9 that results to 11, 
in turn added results 2, making 2 your Seed Digit.

Destiny digit is what you get after adding all the digits of your 'date of birth'. 
e.g. Say your date is 29/11/2000 th. Add all the digits of your date of birth.
2 + 9 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 15 => 1 + 5 = 6. 6 is your destiny number.
